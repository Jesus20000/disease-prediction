# Disease Prediction Project

## Objective
This project predicts diseases based on symptoms using machine learning models.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/disease-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd disease-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess data using `src/data_preprocessing.py`.
2. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train and evaluate models with `src/model_training.py`.
